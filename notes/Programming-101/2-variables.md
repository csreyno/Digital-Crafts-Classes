## Terms
- *Variable* - `Symbolic name given to an unknown quantity that permits the name to be used independent of the information it represents.`
- *Type* - `Also called Data Type, is a classification of a particular 'type' of information. Different languages have different types that are used for different purposes.`
- *String* - `Is a data type that is a grouping of text, numbers, and charecters.`
- *Integer* - `A data type in many languages that represents a real integer. Integers allow for mathmatical operations.`
- *Operator* - `Are characters to preform actions on values and variables.`

## Example of variable in usage

```python
#Varaible getting the value of the string 'Hello World'
# = is the assignment operator
message = "Hello World" 
print(message) 
# The Variable is using the value assigned to it.
```

## How to use variables
- Create a variable and assigning it a value
 ```python
    my_name = "Clint" 
    print("Hello My name is :")
    print(my_name)
 ```
- Re-assigning a value to a variable
```python
    age = 38
    print(age)
    age = 39
    print(age)
```

## Exercises
1. Create a program that has 3 variables named: first_name, last_name, age.
2. The first_name and last_name variable needs to be assigned a string.
3. The age variable needs to be assigned an integer.
4. Make the output look like the following using only print and variables:
```
Hello everybody.
My Name is :
Clint 
Fleetwood
I am :
38
years old!
Goodby.
```
Where "Clint", "Fleetwood", & "38" would be the value of the variables.
