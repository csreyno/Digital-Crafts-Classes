    1.3
    4.5
    -23233.774345
## Programming Math

- ```python
    3+2 #addition
    3-2 #subtraction
    3*2 #multiplication
    3/2 #division
    3+2*3/2 #order of operation

- ```python
    a = 20
    b = 30
    print(b/a) #does not change the values
    print("b now equals ",b)
    print("a still equals ",a)
- ```python
    a = 3 + 6 #assigning an expression to a variable
    b = a / 3 
    print(a)
    print(b)
- ```python
    some_number = 2
    some_number = some_number + 1 #add single number to the var
    some_number += 1 #incrimentor operator (same as above)
    print(some_number)
    some_number -= 1#decrimentor operator
    print(some_number)

## Exercises
1. Write a program that prints out the result of adding two numbers together.
2. Write a program that print sthe results of you age divided by the year you graduated from high school.
3. Write a program that assigns a number to the variable named 'my_number'.
    - Assign another variable named 'increment_by' another number.
    - increase my_number by the incriment_by number 3 times, printing the value of my_number every time.
