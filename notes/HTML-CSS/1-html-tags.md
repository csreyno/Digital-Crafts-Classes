## Terms
- *HTML* - `Html is an acronym for Hypertext Markup Language. It is a language that only describes the stucture and provided content of a document. All websites are creating using HTML`
- *Symantic HTML* - `symantic HTML is concenpt where the html document is written in a way where each tag has meaning and purpose and tags are not used to change the layout or look of a page`
- *HTML Element* - `The actualy item that the tag represents is the html element`
## HTML Tags
- ```html
    <!-- HTML Comment -->
    <div> Content </div>
> A html tag has an 'opening' tag, the content, and a closing tag.
- ```html
    <!-- HTML doesn't care about spaces for the most part -->
    <div>
        Content
        Is spaced
        But not on the page
    </div>
> Modern HTML is expected to be symantic in nature. Make sure you are not using tags to change the look of a website.
## Common HTML tags
- ```html
    <!-- This is just a few items -->
    <div> content </div>
    <span> content </span>
    <h1> Heading 1 </h1>
    <h2> Heading 2 </h2> 
    <!-- down to heading h6 -->
    <p> Paragraph content </p>
    <section> Sectional Content </section>

## Exercise
1. Write a html document that has a div, span, h1-h6, p, and section content.
    - Make the content of each tag type be appropriate to the tag. IE a p should have a small paragraph, a h1 should have a title type content.
    - If you do not know what type of content is appropriate look it up on MDN. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element
