// always use 'let' for variables not 'var' due to differences in the two, 'let' is now more correct


//when you use 'const' you cant over ride it; const a = 100; this will not let you set variable 'a' to anything but 100

let a = 1;
let b = 2;
let c = 3;

const d = 100;

let lowerCase = 10;
console.log(lowerCase)
