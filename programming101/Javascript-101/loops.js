//Exercise 1
//Using a while loop add numbers from 1 to 10.
// let i   = 1;
// let sum = 0;
// while (i < 11) {
//   sum += i;
//   i++;
// }
// console.log(sum)

//Exercise 2
//Using a for loop, count from a number of your choice to another number.

//Exercise 3
// Using a for loop, start with a number and then divide and replace that number by each number from 6 to 2.

let n = 100     //choose a number

for(let i = 6; i > 1; n/i; i--){
    console.log(n) 
}



//Exercise 4
// Using either type of loop add all of the numbers not divisible by 2 and 3 from 0 to a number of your choice.
